# page-replacement-checker

Designed and developed a page replacement checker tool using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Incorporated visualization and simulation of algorithms like LRU and FIFO."

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## ALgorithm Used

- **LRU (Least Recently Used):**
This algorithm replaces the page that has not been accessed for the longest duration of time.
It keeps track of the usage history of each page and selects the least recently used page for replacement.

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):**
This algorithm replaces the oldest page in the memory.
It maintains a queue of pages and when a new page needs to be brought into memory, it replaces the page that has been in the memory the longest.

- **OPT (Optimal Page Replacement):**
The OPT algorithm is an optimal page replacement algorithm that selects the page that will not be used for the longest duration in the future for replacement.
It requires knowledge of the future page requests, which is not realistic in practical scenarios.
However, in the "Page Replacement Checker" tool, it can be simulated by assuming complete knowledge of future page requests to showcase the optimal page replacement strategy.
